Look at the data
In this task we have 50000 28x28 images of digits from 0 to 9. We will train a classifier on this data.

Linear model
Your task is to train a linear classifier $\vec{x} \rightarrow y$ with SGD using TensorFlow.

You will need to calculate a logit (a linear transformation) $z_k$ for each class:$$z_k = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{w_k} + b_k \quad k = 0..9$$

And transform logits $z_k$ to valid probabilities $p_k$ with softmax:$$p_k = \frac{e^{z_k}}{\sum_{i=0}^{9}{e^{z_i}}} \quad k = 0..9$$

We will use a cross-entropy loss to train our multi-class classifier:$$\text{cross-entropy}(y, p) = -\sum_{k=0}^{9}{\log(p_k)[y = k]}$$

where$$
[x]=\begin{cases}
       1, \quad \text{if $x$ is true} \\
       0, \quad \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$

Cross-entropy minimization pushes $p_k$ close to 1 when $y = k$, which is what we want.

Here's the plan:

Flatten the images (28x28 -> 784) with X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], -1)) to simplify our linear model implementation
Use a matrix placeholder for flattened X_train
Convert y_train to one-hot encoded vectors that are needed for cross-entropy
Use a shared variable W for all weights (a column $\vec{w_k}$ per class) and b for all biases.
Aim for ~0.93 validation accuracy

X_train_flat = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], -1))

MLP with hidden layers
Previously we've coded a dense layer with matrix multiplication by hand. But this is not convenient, you have to create a lot of variables and your code becomes a mess. In TensorFlow there's an easier way to make a dense layer:

hidden1 = tf.layers.dense(inputs, 256, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid)
That will create all the necessary variables automatically. Here you can also choose an activation function (remember that we need it for a hidden layer!).

Now define the MLP with 2 hidden layers and restart training with the cell above.

You're aiming for ~0.97 validation accuracy here.

In [19]:
# write the code here to get a new `step` operation and then run the cell with training loop above.
# name your variables in the same way (e.g. logits, probas, classes, etc) for safety.
